# Java (Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance and Polymorphism)

**Hello everyone!**

My name is [Stefano Caramagno](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stefanocaramagno), and I'm pleased to present this repository containing exercises on **abstraction, encapsulatiom, inheritance and polymorphism** implemented in **Java programming**. <br>
These exercises were completed as part of the **Object-Oriented Programming** course during my [Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering](https://www.dieei.unict.it/corsi/l-8-inf) at the [University of Catania](https://www.unict.it).

## üåç Context

This repository explores the concepts of abstraction, encapsulatiom, inheritance, polymorphism, and object-oriented design principles in Java programming. <br>
The exercises cover topics such as class inheritance, method overriding, interface implementation, polymorphic behavior, and practical applications of polymorphism in software development.

## üéØ Objectives

- **Understanding Inheritance**: Learn how to use inheritance to create a class hierarchy that promotes code reuse and logical relationships between classes.
- **Understanding Polymorphism**: Gain proficiency in implementing polymorphic behavior through method overriding and interface implementation.
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Apply object-oriented design principles to model relationships and interactions between classes using polymorphism.

## üìÇ Contents

- **Class Inheritance**: Exercises on implementing a class hierarchy to demonstrate inheritance and method overriding in Java.
- **Interface Implementation**: Exercises on creating interfaces and implementing them in classes to achieve polymorphic behavior.
- **Polymorphic Applications**: Exercises on developing practical applications that leverage polymorphism for flexible and reusable code.
- **Advanced Concepts**: Exercises on exploring advanced topics such as abstract classes, interface inheritance, and polymorphic method parameters.
